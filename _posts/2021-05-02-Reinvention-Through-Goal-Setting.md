Another eight months have flown by since my last post. Time has not stopped so why has my motivation? Do I really want to be a better writer, do I really want to be more focused, do I really want to be in better physical shape? Maybe the issue is with wanting, wanting is defined as "have a desire to possess or do (something); wish for." Wish for a better life or create one is a theme I battle with, progressing in life is important and I do it subconsciously. However, what could I achieve with conscious effort?

Do I lack passion? Do I lack desire? Where is my drive? Why do I fail to hold myself accountable?

In an effort to remove some of the doubt, solidify these wants, and ultimately forge these habits I have chosen to use a goal setting framework and measure my next year. OKRs also known as "Objectives and Key Results". OKRs are defined as a goal-setting tool to create challenging, ambitions goals with measurable results. They are used to track progress, focus, and encourage engagement from others for radical transparency(*Thank you Ray Dalio*). 

The three objectives for the year are all around personal growth.

<h2>Yearly Objectives</h2>
 <h4>Grow Physically: As Measured By</h4>
* Lose 25 pounds.
* Ten unassisted pull ups(strict).
* Kick a 50 yard field goal.

 <h4>Grow Professionally: As Measured By</h4>
* Obtain 24 college credits.
* Participate in my company's hackathon.
* Kick a 50 yard field goal.

 <h4>Grow Intellectually: As Measured By</h4>
* Reading 20 books.
* Developing a decentralized application using blockchain.
* Write 52 blog posts.

I am going to be using this first month of may as my test run and the key results needed for this month include the following.

<h2>May Key Results</h2>
 <h4>Grow Physically: Key Results</h4>
* 100% of workouts completed (M,T,W,TH,F,S)
* M-W-F (Weights).

* Enroll in college.
* Sign up for toast masters.

 <h4>Grow Intellectually: Key Results</h4>

This month is all about doing more and talking less.
