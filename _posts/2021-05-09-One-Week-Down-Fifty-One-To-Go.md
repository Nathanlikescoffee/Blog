This week has been a bit of a whirlwind....

Monday through Thursday work meetings have taken up over 26 of the 32 hours allotted - on top of that I have been arriving earlier, working late, after hours drinks, coaching, you name it. Sometimes at work I get distracted in my free time about building my own company or focusing on a passion that I want to develop when I really need to be focusing on my job. This doesn't lend itself to really achieving my professional goals so in the coming weeks I want to make sure I am being mindful of my time and committing myself to the moment and not the future. 

Some highlights from the week!
* Friday I took PTO and went on an amazing fishing trip. 
* Friday night I played a poker game and lost 120$ but learned some valuable lessons. (Patience and not hero calling so much)
* Today I knocked out the Honey To Do List! (Mowed, built dining room chairs, Replaced railing in the staircase, and meal prepped)

Some negatives from the week!
* Lacked focus at work 
* Didn't catch any fish
* Failed to complete any Pomodoros until Sunday.

With focusing on goals, tasks, productivity, being optimal, the week has flown by. Hitting all my workouts has been a challenge. I missed Fridays workout which I made up for by doing a double workout on Saturday but that feels a bit like cheating. Running has completely bricked my calves, not sure if its a lack of stretching beforehand or just my body not used to putting in the miles (13 miles completed last week). I have proven to myself that I have the will power necessary to complete my running commitments but everytime I go out it does not feel any easier. Any advice on getting into the groove and focusing less on pain of running and more on the joy? This coming week I want to make sure I am prepped for my runs and if nothing else focus less on the pain of it all.

Reading on the other hand has been going great! I finished Measure What Matters on Monday but will not be counting that in the "2 for the month" key result due to being 1/4th of the way through before the month started. I picked up Atomic Habits and am blasting through it, I should have it finished later this week and onto "Deep Work" by Cal Newport. I noticed with reading these books, its more about making sure I understand the messaging and previously I have kind of sub consciously gone through the pages without really practicing what they preach. To resolve this - next week I am going to ask my self some simple questions after each chapter. 

* What question(s) would you ask the author if you had the chance?
* What are the least — and most — important parts of what you’re reading? What are the main ideas?
* What does this reading remind you of? Any particular feeling, thought, or event?

Lastly programming has been a struggle. I failed to make any meaningful progress until today by binging 100 minutes of focused work (4 Pomodoros). To resolve this I am going to take a note out of Atomic Habits by creating an implementation intention! 

* Mondays - Wednesdays - Fridays I will Program at 8pm in the office.
* Tuesdays - Thursday I will Program at 7am in the office.

Whenever you want to change your behavior, ask yourself:

* How can I make it obvious? (Set an alarm)
* How can I make it attractive? (Reflection in the blog)
* How can I make it easy? (Everything is setup and planned out beforehand)
* How can I make it satisfying? (Reflection in the blog)

The best part about this week is I feel like I have already changed. Granted it's a small increment but I accomplished more this week then I have in any of the past weeks by being focused on my goals and coming with intent each day.
