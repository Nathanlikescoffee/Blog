<p class="meta">Weekly Fitness Routine</p>

The current 3 day split I am doing is perfect for my current level of fitness. Working from home creates a pretty inactive life style so I try to hit the gym even on "off" days as well as going for 1-2 30minute walks a day.

The pull workout hits lats, biceps, and traps, the push workout hits chest, triceps, and shoulders, and the third workout is all legs. I currently use the gym provided at my apartment complex which includes some simple machines as well as dumb bells ranging from 5 pounds to 75 pounds.

<H2> Push Workout </H2>
* Bench Press Machine - 5 sets - 5 reps - 165 lbs.
* Dumbbell Press - 3 sets - 10 reps - 55lbs dumbbells.
* Chest Flys - 3 sets - 10 reps - 25lbs each side.
* Dumbbell Press - 3 sets - 10 reps - 40lbs dumbbells.
* Side Raises - 3 sets - 10 reps - 20lb dumbbells.
* Tricep Pulldown - 3 sets - 10 reps - 65lbs
* 20min jog - 5.5 mph
 
<H2> Pull Workout </H2>
* Pullups - 3 sets - 5 reps - bodyweight.
* Lat Pulldowns - 3 sets - 10 reps - 135 lbs.
* Barbell Rows - 3 sets - 10 reps - 50lb dumbells.
* Underhand Lat Pulldowns - 3 sets - 10 reps - 100 lbs.
* Dumbbell curls - 3 sets - 10 reps - 25lbs dumbbells.
* Hammer curls - 3 sets - 10 reps - 25lbs dumbbells.
* 20min jog - 5.5 mph

<H2> Leg Workout </H2>
* Lunges - 3 sets - 10 reps each leg - bodyweight.
* SDL - 3 sets - 10 reps - 55lb dumbbells.
* Calf raises - 3 sets - 10 reps - bodyweight.
* Squats - 3 sets - 10 reps - bodyweight.
* 30min jog 5mph

<H2> Rest Day </H2>
* 20min jog 6mph.

Every two to three weeks I try and increase each workout by 2.5 - 5 pounds and will be tracking progress via the blog. Abs are done every morning as a part of my morning routine. This workout is great for me but not be great for you, do some
research before deciding what fitness routine to follow.
