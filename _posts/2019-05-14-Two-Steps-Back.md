Started off on the wrong foot and you could say I instantly tripped. I have failed to keep up with some of the habits I wanted to set in as well as letting my anxeity get a hold of me.

A recap of the past two weeks includes failing to wake up on time, struggles with motivation at work and at home as well, a close friend passing away to substance abuse, a colonoscpy I thought was going to kill me, and a step in
the right direction.

I have witnessed drug abuse ruin the lives of my parents as well as close friends. I can empthazie with addicts, I personally have a constant fight with my own complusive behavior but purposefully do not put my self in positions to get
addicted to soemthing. Compulsive behavior is a trap and you will never escape without a concious effort to do so. It's hard and we are all not created equally, some of us will never escape our own compulsive behaviors and live a life with a 
vice. Is that a bad thing, is it a life wasted? That's for you to decide. If you are looking to get help or know someone that needs help, feel free to give the national drug helpline a call 1-888-633-3239.

My friends passing set me back, reviewing our time together left me empty and questioning what a life well lived meant.

Before I found out he passed away, I was struggling to work on some of the habits I wanted to set in on a daily basis.

*Waking up at 6 am
*Meditating.
*Programming for 15mins.
*Getting out of the apartment for a 30 minute walk + Multitasking with some recommened books.
*Keeping up with chores.
*Asking myself what needs to be done and setting a todo list.

I was waking up after 7-8 hours of sleep not motivated to tackle the day and squandered my time on reddit/facebook/youtube.
The only habit I was able to keep up with was the gym, 1 hour of working out + a 20 minute run seem to be ingrained as a habit. When work is over at 3 I just instantly go to the gym so I guess we can say we turned one healthy activity
into a habit.

After my friends passing my anxiety took a turn and my fear of death gripped me. I had a procedure last week and swore I was going to die because of the anthestia. I could not look past that day and see my future but I don't believe
in my heart of hearts I was going to die, but something in the back of my mind constantly told me I would. So another week went by with my motivation never finding me. 

I survived the procedure or I wouln't be writing this, I was elated. I got much needed rest yesterday and accomplished all the things that I needed to do today as well as writing this blog post.
My fiance and I are flying out to seatlle this weekend for a wedding and I am looking forward to it. 

I am still trying to define what a life well lived is and if I find the answer I will be sure to post it.
