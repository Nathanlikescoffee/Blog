Alright we are missing the mark on almost everything and it's all due to changes in scenery and a lack of self discipline. Working out is still possible while on the road, reading, programming, not drinking are all possible while on vacation, Yet I used it as an excuse to not do the things I said I was going to do. I missed a blog post - failed to work out - binge drank - maybe read 3 pages of a book - and completely forgot about programming. I will say I had an awesome vacation and maybe listening to Dune can count as reading a book - maybe not - but the point is vacation has ruined the rhythm. I even got back on Friday and didn't go to the gym on Saturday - maybe I took a vacation too early into setting habits and goals - or I am just making an excuse. Maybe a goal for not making excuses?

Moving forward I am going to set key results for a three month period - this week I plan on taking some time to meditate and figure out what exactly I want to achieve across that timespan.  

We are still on target for the PPL routine - College also starts July 1st! Reading 3 books is going to be a stretch - I need to finish Can't Hurt Me this week and push for two books next week. Today is an off day from the gym - and I should really focus more on my writing but I randomly got the urge to just go out and run in the rain - just knock it out - will have a better blog post next Sunday or maybe mid week to still hit 5 posts.
