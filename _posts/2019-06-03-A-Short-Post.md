Life has been super easy, great, amazing. However, I have yet to master my self.

I am struggling with bringing my unconcious habits to the light and putting them under focus. Jung said "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate."
I would like to escape this "fate" and seriously focus on some of the below goals for june.

6/3 to 6/30
* Code Daily (15-30 Minutes)
* Finish How To Brew (612 Pages - 22 Pages a Day AVG)
* In bed before 10:30pm
* Walk 30 minutes a day.
* Save 4,000$

The above goals may seem small minded but they are all part of a bigger life goal.

Coding is a part of learning/professional development outside of my current career path.
Brewing is a passion project to make better beer but also develop a hobby offline.
Being in bed before 10:30 to help with clarity and my current lack of sleep.
Walking to benefit my health, working from home really makes you stagnant.
Saving money for a wedding!

For the first four habits, I am going to be follow the chain method popularized by Jerry Seinfield. Everyday I will write an X on my calendar for each habit completed successfuly and at the end
I should have a chain thats 27 days long.

For the last goal with savings, we are following a strict savings regimne that should help us spend less and save more. If anyone is intrested in the budget sheet used feel free to reach out.
