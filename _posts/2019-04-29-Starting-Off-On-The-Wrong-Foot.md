This post was supposed to come out last night but I got distracted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t34_gdPf4c0">motorcycle limbo.</a>(Yes it's as crazy as it sounds)
I want to use blogging as a way to recap my weeks, work on my writing ability, and provide a creative outlet for my thoughts. 
Like alot of things I want it's not always what happens or what my brain decides is worth the attention. Sometimes you want to be that successful writer.
Other times you are staying up till 2am watching motorcycle limbo with no care in the world.

Too recap last week, I started a bunch of new "Habits". I have previously been on this selfimprovement kick before and have tried to change to much just to revert back to old habits.
I have taken a lighter approach with the idea that I will put a clamp on some of the habits/activities that are currently putting a strain on my life, and slowly increase habits
that should positivelytively impact me. Below is a list of my current schedule with an idea on what my future state schedule should look like.
