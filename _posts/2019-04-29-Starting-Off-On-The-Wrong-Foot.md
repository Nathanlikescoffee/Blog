This post was supposed to come out last night, but I got distracted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t34_gdPf4c0">motorcycle limbo.</a>(yes it's as crazy as it sounds)
I want to use blogging as a way to recap my weeks, work on my writing ability, and provide a creative outlet for my thoughts. 
Like a lot of things I want it's not always what happens or what my brain decides is worth the attention. Sometimes you want to be that successful writer.
Other times you are staying up till 2 am watching motorcycle limbo with no care in the world.

Too recap last week; I started a bunch of new habits. I have previously been on this self-improvement kick before and have tried to change to much just to revert back to old habits.
I have taken a lighter approach with the idea that I will put a clamp on some of the habits/activities that are currently putting a strain on my life and slowly increase habits
that should positively impact me. Below is a list of my current schedule with an idea on what my future state schedule should look like.

 <h2>Current Schedule:</h2>
* Wake up at 8am -> Coffee,Get Ready for the Day, Shower
* 9am to 11am -> Start work, catch up on emails, minor projects + meetings
* 11am to 2pm -> Procrastinate, reddit, fuck around.
* 2pm to 4pm -> Play video games? Nap? 
* 4pm to 6pm -> Gym and dinner.
* 6pm to 11pm -> Leisure
* 11pm to 2am -> More procrastination, reddit, motorcycle limbo.

<h2>Optimized Schedule:</h2>
* Wake up at 6am -> Coffee, Get Ready for the Day, Shower
* 7am to 8am -> Task list, prioritize the day, minor media / news.
* 8am to 10am -> Focused work, prioritized earier by the task list.
* 10am to 1030am -> Walk + Audio Book
* 1030am to 11am -> Notes and recap what I listened too.
* 11am to 2pm -> Lunch + Focused project work.
* 2pm to 3pm -> Gym
* 3pm to 330pm -> Chores
* 330pm to 430pm -> Reading
* 430 to 630pm -> Programming
* 630pm to 10pm -> Leisure
* 10pm to 11pm -> Reading


Going from 13 hours of wasted time too 3.5 hours is still a gigantic change and will be done slowly. 
Part of my effort to achieve this includes a lot of books on focus/efficiency/meeting goals.
In the coming weeks I will keep track of my actual time spent on various activities and post a weekly recap of getting to my desired schedule(weekends are still up in the air).

A quick recap of last week.
* Scheduled a procedure.
* Met the owner of a local tap house.
* Finished 5 chapters of The Effective Exectuvive.
* 3 hours of python training completed.
* Caught up on all work related tickets.
* Played too much videogames.
* Brewed my first batch of beer. (recipe to come soon)
* Cleaned the apartment, went out to eat multiple times, and watched GOT.
* Ran a total of 11 miles last week, and missed the gym twice. (5/7)

Questions to ask myself next week
* Am I a better person than I was last week?
* What am I most thankful for?
* What am I most passionate about?

Tasks for next week!
* Finish the Effective Executive.
* Complete my python training.
* Read 2+ Chapters of "How to Brew"
* Create a list of podcasts + books that need to be listened too.
* Time tracking + Gym tracking.


Thanks for taking your time to read my first blog post, I doubt it will be my best work but hopefully this helps me become more mindful and allows me an outlet to grow creatively.
