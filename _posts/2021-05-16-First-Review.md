"Continuous effort - not strength or intelligence - is the key to unlock our potential" - Churchill.

As a child I dreamed of becoming a secret agent, but its not really a secret when you want everyone to know you are a secret agent. Status, pride, position - it's not who I am but how others perceived me that bases my self worth and today in a lot of ways still do. You don't hear me say "Oh sorry I forgot about that", "It's not my fault", or "It's too hard" in relation to who I was and my short comings. Always owning up to the lethargic and apathetic reasons for failure to change I would describe my inability as trying to run in the sand with two anchors strapped to my feet. As I run I would see everyone else anchor-less and paving a way to who they wanted to become! I envied anyone who naturally just did productive things because anytime I would try those anchors would not budge, I have always chalked that up to my innate abilities. A mixture of nature and nurture - the dice rolled a certain way - and low and behold you are a product of all your previous outcomes. God was I wrong...

<h1>The Thoughts Behind May:</h1>

The key results for May are all around building sustained habits to forge my new identity. From lazy to hard working, lethargic to athletic, scatter brained to intellectual. Creating results like 100% of workouts completed for the month, 24 hours of programming outside of work, and reading two books have forced me to develop habits to reach those goals.
 
<h2>Growing Physically:</h2>

Growing physically has been a challenge but easily adopted, all I have to do is put my shoes on and get out out the door. I have run over 21 miles so far this month, that's 19 miles more then all of last year combined! Running has not gotten any easier but I have gotten a little faster! My first 5k was run at a 12:30 pace and I am down into the 11:15s, everytime I go out on the track I try to continue running a little further each lap before I walk to catch my breathe. Hoping soon I can sustain a full 5k with no breaks at a 11min pace - from that I can build up my speed and get down to a 24 min 5k by the end of the year. Lifting wise my body weight routine has been great - it's the same routine I blogged about in 2020 - I think next months goal will include 5x5 strength training to get me out and into the gym furthering my progress. I feel great about hitting my key results here by the end of the month!

<h2>Growing Professionally:</h2>
Signing up for College and Toast Masters should be a breeze - so why haven't I done it? This next week is critical - I will sign up for toast masters tomorrow and reach out to my college counselor to see what's going on with my enrollment. 

<h2>Growing Intellectually:</h2>
I have reduced my average screen time with my phone from the start of the month at 2 hours and 30 minutes a day down to 1 hour and 15 minutes. A lot of that time has been filled up with reading and explains why I have been crushing books! I completed Atomic Habits last week and am already 150 pages into Deep Work! I think I will hit 4 books by the end of the month so not too worried about reaching that goal! 

Programming on the other hand has been terrible - I have completed 250 minutes of the 1160 minutes needed in the month. This is partially due to bad scheduling on my part and not developing the habit. A better goal for the month would of been measuring how many days in a row - time untracked - I was able to sit down and program outside of work. Also the habit I shared last week did not get any traction due to some nights not being home on time for said habit! When it came to working out - I ended up doing that in the morning for those nights - I should of also sat down to do some programming. I can still hit my key result but going forward I am changing how its tracked. 15 days of programming at an average of hour a day I should be able to reach my goal while also creating a habit chain in the process. 

Blog posts are coming in strong - my writing is still poor but that could be due to my lack of intent on getting better. Next month I will create a quality metric to track progress.
