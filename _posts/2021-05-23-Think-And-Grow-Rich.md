"Every man is what he is, because of the dominating thoughts which he permits to occupy his mind." - Napoleon Hill

Today the rain fell and I was given a chance to just be consumed by reading. I ,somehow someway, lost my copy of Deep Work and was a little lost to start the day. The next book on my list after Deep Work is rereading Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins but instead of diving through that again I went ahead and found my copy of Think and Grow Rich, of all places, under my bed! How did I even hear about this book written by Napoleon Hill over 25 years and published in 1937! Well,I came across the book when I stumbled upon a Youtube video by Bob Proctor that discussed if we knew who we are. In the video he says he carries a copy of Think and Grow Rich around with him and its one of the only books he rereads and comes back to constantly - like a text book. Fast forward 10 months and I am browsing the 7$ section of a Barnes and Noble's and come across a paper back version of the book and decided to pick it up! When I brought it home my wife instantly opened it up to the chapter about sexual transmutation - we had a good laugh - I read the authors preface - was moved but ended up falling asleep and having it slip behind my bed!  Fast forward back to the current day and I reached down and picked the book back up. 

I started reading it around 9am in the morning and finished it at 4pm - I ended up underlining a lot of thoughts from Hill that inspired me! Below are a few:

* "There are no limitations to the mind except those we acknowledge." 
* "Plain, unemotional words do not influence the subconscious mind. You will get no appreciable results until you learn to reach your subconscious mind with thoughts or spoken words which have been well emotionalized with belief."
* "Knowledge is only potential power. It becomes power only when, and if, it is organized into definite plans of action, and directed to a definite end." 
* "Both success and failure are largely the results of habit."
* "Success requires no explanations - failure permits no alibis"
* "No man is ever beaten, until he quits - in his own mind." 
* "The man who wavers in his decisions shows that he is not sure of himself. He cannot lead others successfully."
* "Self mastery is the hardest job you will ever tackle."
* "Inability to organize details. Efficient leadership calls for ability to organize and to master details. No genuine leader is ever "too busy" to do anything which may be required of him in his capacity as leader. When a man, whether he is a leader or follower, admits that he is "to busy" to change his plans, or give to attention to any emergency, he admits his inefficiency. The successful leader must be the master of all details connected with his position. That means, of course, that he must acquire the habit of relegating details to capable lieutenants" 

On one side the book covers a lot of ethereal and meta items within the universe - the power of attraction is not lost at all and to some may be too much to get past and learn from this book. If you can create an idea or goal so vivid - develop a plan and discipline towards that idea and its manifestation - practice and practice and practice - let it consume you - the universe will give you opportunities to manifest it into reality....On the other side - its exactly what I needed to hear. I still struggle with making the conscious - subconscious. Becoming your thoughts - the ideal self - is as the book states the hardest job I will ever tackle.

In other news I completed one of my key results for the month with finishing two books! Hopefully I find Deep Work later this week and finish that one as well! Programming on the other hand continues to be a slow burn, its a want - and the only way to manifest a want into reality is by setting up good habits. I believe I will still hit my time needed for the month to conquer my goal but I have missed the essence of this month and the goal - developing the habit of programming will most definitely be a focus in June. Working out has been the easiest habit to develop - I would say the past 5 years have really set me up for success in this area.  This coming week I will be working on the Key Results for June!
